This home-based application for the assessment of upper-limb impairment uses the Azure Kinect motion capture system.

The attached Unity project contains five scenes:
-Flex, for the analysis of shoulder and elbow flexibility
-Flow, for the analysis of arm stability
-Conformance, for the analysis of arm motion conformity and precision
-Flash, for the analysis of arm dynamics and reactivity
-Graph, for the depiction of user results day on day.

Mixed reality and augmented reality technologies, along with gamification strategies were implemented to create an immersive and engaging environment.

Accessibility and ease of access was carefully considered, using voice control and accomodating users in a seated pose.

For best body-tracking quality, the Azure Kinect should be placed 1.4m-1.6m away from the user, at a height of 1.4m-1.6m and a tilt of 15-30 degrees downwards.

The project utilised a Unity Asset available here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/body-tracking-for-orbbec-femto-bolt-mega-azure-kinect-157915#description.
The asset has not been included due to legal restrictions on software protection.
